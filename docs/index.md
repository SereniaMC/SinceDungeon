SinceDungeon is a Paper 1.21 dungeon plugin for instanced, configurable dungeon runs. It provides template-world
instancing, staged objectives, built-in party support, lives and cooldown systems, reward chests, leaderboards,
PlaceholderAPI support, an in-game editor, and an extensible Java API.

## Plugin Packages

- **SinceDungeon Core**: dungeon engine, commands, editor, actions, rewards, top boards, lives, cooldowns, database,
  Redis/cross-server support, and developer API.
- **SinceDungeon Premium Addon**: advanced dungeon actions, roulette rewards, hologram drops, hologram leaderboards,
  Mythic+ affixes, Discord webhooks, native TextDisplay holograms, and extra MythicMobs item integration.

## Core Concepts

| Concept        | What it does                                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Template world | A source world folder copied into a temporary dungeon instance.                              |
| Dungeon file   | A YAML file in `plugins/SinceDungeon/dungeons/<id>.yml`.                                     |
| Stage          | A numbered step in the dungeon. Each stage can contain one or more actions.                  |
| Action         | An objective such as reaching a location, clearing mobs, opening a door, or fighting a boss. |
| Rewards        | Completion grants reward chest sessions based on clear time tiers.                           |
| Party          | Built-in party system, with an API override for custom party plugins.                        |
| Lives          | Player life pool used for entry requirements, death penalties, and revive items.             |
| Cooldowns      | Per-dungeon cooldowns after completion or early exit, depending on config.                   |
| Top boards     | Database-backed leaderboard categories for time, party time, kills, and clears.              |

Premium `SCHEMATIC` shared-world mode works on Paper and Folia. On Folia, Core template-world copy mode is blocked
before a run starts because Folia cannot create Bukkit worlds at runtime; use schematic mode with a preloaded shared
world.
